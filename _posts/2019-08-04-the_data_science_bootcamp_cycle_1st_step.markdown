A couple of months ago, I saw an ad where a 38 year old woman quit her job as a flight attendant to pursue a career as a software engineer.  She applied at a coding bootcamp to upskill herself and give her the opportunity of succeeding in this industry.  This woman, let’s name her Grace just because a personal touch will make it easier to relate, succeeded in her dream and got offered a job at an edtech company as a software engineer.  She was the impetus for my own journey in trying to achieve this goal of mine of becoming a “Data Scientist”.  After I watched that ad, I went ahead and requested information at the same bootcamp she went through and 2 months later, I am embarking on this journey of totally transitioning my career.  

To give you context of where I was in my own career, I taught English in South Korea for 8 years.  After coming back to America, I became an Admissions Counselor (AC) representing a Masters in Data Science program at one of the best private research universities in the U.S. (or so they say, but their basketball program is pretty good).  At the time, I had no idea what the field was, let alone what R and Python were.  I engrossed myself in learning the field and also our curriculum, and through that, I became fascinated with Data.  It’s like wishing and wanting to be a doctor because it’s cool, but just wishful thinking.  The more I talked to students, the more my knowledge of the field grew. After a couple of months, I became the residential guru of our curriculum and the field (which really doesn’t say much because most of our ACs knowledge about Data Science in the program were very elementary).  My conversations with prospective students also made me realize that they also did not really understand what Data Science was.  Some of them just wanted a Masters in their resume,  and some just wanted to earn more money, which are all relevant reasons.  I started thinking maybe this might not be a bad idea, but still I kept it off thinking to myself this is just too far-fetched.

At that time, I was struggling mentally to really find the career that I wanted for myself.  I liked being an Admissions Counselor, but I knew that I needed something more fulifilling and quite frankly, more challenging for myself.  I was also encouraged by my fiance (Sarah)  at the time.  She was always supportive in whichever direction I wanted to go to as long as I find happiness in it. 

Then I saw that ad.  I had known that there were bootcamps out there that trains people and gives them the basic understanding of Data Science, but more importantly, give them some of the foundational technical tools to actually be a Data Scientist! I went ahead and requested information (now the Admissions Counselor turned into a prospective student!), and before I knew it, I was prepping myself to take the technical interview to be admitted into a bootcamp.  Long story short, here I am embarking on this 10 month adventure of trying to be a Data Scientist.  It’s a challenge that I’m willing to take, not only to better myself, but to also upskill and provide some versatility in my career.  More importantly, I am doing this for Sarah who has been the most supportive in my journey to find my passion in life.  I don't know yet if Data Science IS my passion--the field itself is so broad.  I also don't know if I will survive this bootcamp.  But the fact that I'm actually sitting here at a WeWork prepping myself to analyze the whole text of Macbeth using Python is something I would have never imagined a couple of months ago.  

So far, it has been challenging from the get-go! We will see where this will take me, but writing this blog is a first step (and my first assignment!) to fulfilling that goal.  9 months and 3 weeks to go.
